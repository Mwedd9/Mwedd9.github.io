			<p>To be, or not to be, that is the question:
			Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
			The slings and arrows of <span class="word-adjective-1"> outrageous</span> fortune,
			Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
			And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,
			No more; and by a sleep to say we end
			The heart-ache and the thousand <span class="word-adjective-2">natural </span> shocks
			That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation like painting with a <span class="art-supply"> art </span>
			Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
			To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub. I quickly surfed the <span class="computer-software"> web </span> looking for an escape, I found <span class="website-name"> headspace </span> 
			The story is about a fish with shiny, multi-colored scales named the <span class="artist-name"> Rainbow Fish. </span> He has blue, green, and purple scales; and among them, he has shiny silver scales he is always fond of, until one day, a small fish asks him if he could have one, to which the Rainbow Fish refuses in a very rude manner. The other <span class="celebrity-name"> fish </span> are very upset about his behavior and don't want to play with him anymore.

			Feeling upset, his only remaining  <span class="word-noun-1"> friend, </span> the starfish, tells him to go visit the wise octopus for advice. She explains that the <span class="word-noun-2">  waves </span> have told her his story. 

			When he encounters the small fish a second time, the Rainbow Fish gives him one of his precious <span class="plural-noun-1"> scales </span> and, seeing the joy of this little fish, immediately feels much better. Very soon the Rainbow Fish is surrounded by other fish requesting scales and he gives to each of them one of his shiny scales.

			Finally, in the end, despite having one shiny scale left (as he has given them all away to the other fish), he becomes very happy.</p>
