	unsteady. I keep moving around and my emotions change often. nothing feels very consistent. I don't think this is either good or bad. but definitely unsteady. trying a lot of things out, like guess and check. I feel like I'm under construction.  
	</div>


	<div id="raph" class="raph">
	Steady. I feel like I have a plan I’m just always asking myself if I’m happy. Like with who I am not with what I’m doing, if that makes sense. 
	</div>


	<div id="dillon" class="dillon">
	Honestly, some days it's a bit of both. There are days where I'll be somewhat depressed and fearful because of what the world is turning into. Hate, racism, bigotry, unnecessary violence.... But then there are days where I'm happy cause I remind myself there are people who so kind hearted, that you wouldn't think they're human in a spiritual sense, but something more divine. Rome wasn't built in a day, the same can be said about fixing our world. I hope this answers your question, because I was so confused on how to go about this.

	<div id="julia" class="julia">
	I feel steady in the fact that I'm at college and doing fine. But I'm questioning my passions and career path. 
	</div>


	<div id="amber" class="amber">
	I feel steady, for the first time in a while! Not sure what my future looks like, but I’ve finally come to terms with where I’m at now, and I’m okay with that. 
	</div>

	<div id="chris" class="chris">
	Unsteady, my emotions and thus thoughts are highly flexible in relation to how comfortable I am in different situations 
	</div>

	<div id="grace" class="grace">
	Unsteady. I  feel unsteady when I don’t know what I want and am also not able to find peace with that uncertainty. When I feel steady, it’s because I know what I want and I’m working towards it or I can find peace with that uncertainty. 
	</div>

	<div id="ro" class="ro">
	steady, things are confusing but the overall direction I’m heading in seems to be pretty steady 
	</div>

	<div id="lee" class="lee">
	Hi! I’m not quite sure what this question means. If I had to say, I think I would go with unsteady because I think that’s the nature of life (though maybe that’s my anxiety speaking.) but in all honesty, I choose not to believe in fate/destiny/predetermination, and I think that life is absurd. Whether this is a question about how “happy” I am, or how “secure” I feel, I guess then the answers would differ. Right now, I think I’m happier than other days. As for the latter, I don’t know if security is something I’ve felt since I reached a certain level of awareness. Unsteady I think is the way it is.

	<div id="lind" class="lind">
	I feel steady. Having school as a constant structure to my week helps. I am not experiencing enough consecutive drastic changes in my life, so things seem spaced out enough that I get the illusion of stability.
	</div>

	<div id="gavin" class="gavin">
	Unsteady, because I’m unsure of my career path and where life will exactly take me.
	</div>
