<!-- for this project I used two ideas in conjunction, the self help industry being a way to provide impersonal and broad advice in order to make people falsly feel like they have their lives together. I also made my spokesperson a humanoid/robot avatar to show the coldness this imformation is being presented from. An avatar is a fake form that is often what the avatar creator wants to be seen as. Using these two I wanted to make an ironic and impersonal experience for the user, I used an API, a randon generative source of data for my "advice" to exhibit the way this self help advice is not personally tailored to the recipiant. Click on the face for new advice! :) -->
